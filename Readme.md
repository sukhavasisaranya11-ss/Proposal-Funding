# Proposal Funding

## Project Description

Build automatic funding for approved proposals through a decentralized smart contract system. This project enables users to create funding proposals, manage approval processes, and automatically distribute funds to approved proposals on the Aptos blockchain.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, decentralized, and efficient funding mechanism that eliminates intermediaries and reduces bureaucracy in proposal funding. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to build a trustless system where approved proposals receive automatic funding based on predefined criteria and community governance.

The platform empowers communities, organizations, and individuals to:
- Submit funding proposals with clear requirements
- Participate in decentralized decision-making processes
- Ensure automatic and transparent fund distribution
- Create a sustainable ecosystem for innovation and development
